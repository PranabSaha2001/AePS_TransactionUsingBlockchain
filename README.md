# FINAL YEAR PROJECT ON CYBER SECURITY
# Securing AEPS trasanctions using Blockchain Technology
AEPS(Aadhaar Enabled Payment System) is a revolutionary technology that has the potential to transform financial inclusion in India. This presentation explores the benefits of integrating blockchain technology with AEPS to enhance security, transparency, and efficiency in the financial ecosystem.

AEPS is a biometric-based payment system that allows individuals to access their bank accounts, make transactions, and withdraw cash using their Aadhaar number and fingerprint authentication. With over 1.2 billion Aadhaar enrollments, AEPS has the potential to reach the unbanked population and provide them with easy access to financial services.
# Problems with AEPS and their solutions using Blockchain
Several frauds are led out across the country using the fingerprints collected. Such frauds, Man in the Middle attacks, all this could be easily handled by securing the transactions using Blockchain.

The transactions would be secured since just getting the fingerprints would not help the attackers. They would require a private key along with the fingerprints to carryout the frauds.

The hash of the fingerprint data would be used for the transactions, so even if there is slightest of chance of Man in the Middle attack, and the attacker getting the hash but there is no chance of getting the original data since hash is irreversible.
# Encryption Concepts to gain knowledge for this project
